Introduction to Galaxy and NGS Data Structures
==================================

## Step 1: Register for Galaxy (and validate the registration)

For users in Europe and Asia, register at [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/)

For users in Americas, register at [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)

For users in Australia, register at [https://usegalaxy.org.au/](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)

For the remainder of the course, useGalaxy will refer to the website of your choice. 

After registering for useGalaxy, you will receive a validation email. Activate the registration by following the steps specified in the validation email.

## Step 2: Install FTP Client

For uploading large data to Galaxy, it is suggested to use FTP. For this, an FTP client is needed. One such tool is [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php). 

Download and install [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) or any other [FTP client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_FTP_client_software). 

## Step 3: Download Raw Data 

For first session, we will map data from zebrafish. Download the raw data from [here](https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/raw/master/Data/Zebrafish.fastq.gz)

With this, you are ready to dive into the entertaining world of NGS Analysis!
