Introduction to Galaxy and NGS Data Structures
==================================

## Step 1: Register for Galaxy (and validate the registration)

For users in Europe and Asia, register at [https://usegalaxy.eu/](https://usegalaxy.eu/)

For users in Americas, register at [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)

For users in Australia, register at [https://usegalaxy.org.au/](https://usegalaxy.org.au/)

For the remainder of the course, useGalaxy will refer to the website of your choice. 

After registering for useGalaxy, you will receive a validation email. Activate the registration by following the steps specified in the validation email.

## Step 2: Install FTP Client

For uploading large data to Galaxy, it is suggested to use FTP. For this, an FTP client is needed. One such tool is [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php). 

Download and install FileZilla or any other [FTP client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_FTP_client_software). 

## Step 3: Start RStudio and test your installation

Start RStudio on your computer. You should see a screen like the one below:

You will see the version of R that is installed in the lower left block. 
In the image above, it says: R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) -- "Action of the Toes"

With this, you are ready to dive into the entertaining world of R programming!
