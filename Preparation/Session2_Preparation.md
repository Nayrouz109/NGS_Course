RNA-Seq. Analysis
==================================

In this session, we will perform RNA-Seq. analysis in Galaxy. For this, you only need to [download this file and unzip it.](https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/raw/master/Data/Session2_Data.zip): https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/raw/master/Data/Session2_Data.zip

The zip files contains four paired-end fastq files generated in zebrafish. It contains two control replicates and two treated replicates. We will try to identify differentially expressed genes between the two conditions.

With this, you are ready for Session 2!
