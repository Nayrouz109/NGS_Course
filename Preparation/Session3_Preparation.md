In this session, we will perform detailed analysis of RNA-Seq. count data and perform  

RNA-Seq. Analysis
==================================

Step 1: Generate count files by following [the exercise for Session 2 from Step 1 - 5](https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/blob/master/Exercises/Session2_Exercise.md). 



ATAC-Seq. Analysis
================================

In this session, we will map ATAC-Seq. raw data to the genome and identify peaks. For this, [download this file and unzip it.](https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/raw/master/Data/atac_raw_files.zip): https://github.com/sumeetpalsingh/NGS_Course/raw/master/Data/atac_raw_files.zip

The zip files contains two paired-end fastq files generated in zebrafish. It contains ATAC-Seq. data from two tissues. We will try to identify differentially expressed genes between the two tissues.

With this, you are ready for Session 3!
